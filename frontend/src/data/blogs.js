            <p>Finding a flatmate is more than just sharing rent; it's about sharing a life, or at least a living space. Here are ten tips to help you find the perfect match:</p>
            <br/>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">1. Be Honest About Your Lifestyle</h3>
            <p>Don't say you're neat if you're messy. Honesty upfront prevents conflicts later.</p>
            <br/>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">2. Discuss Finances Early</h3>
            <p>Make sure you're on the same page about rent, bills, and shared expenses.</p>
            <br/>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">3. Check References</h3>
            <p>It might feel awkward, but asking for a previous landlord or roommate reference is smart.</p>
            <br/>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">4. Meet in Person</h3>
            <p>A video call is good, but meeting in person gives you a better vibe check.</p>
            <br/>
            <h3 class="text-xl font-bold">5. Discuss Guest Policies</h3>
            <p>How do you feel about partners staying over? Parties? define boundaries.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Following these tips can save you a lot of headaches down the road. Good luck!</p>
